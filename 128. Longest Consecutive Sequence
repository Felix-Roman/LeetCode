128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Medium
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

class Solution(object):
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return 0

        num_set = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1

                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current+=1
                    streak+=1

                longest = max(longest,streak)
        return longest
